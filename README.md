In this mini-project the goal is to perform an image analysis prediction challenge. The task is based upon the MNIST dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). The original MNIST contains handwritten numeric digits from 0-9 and the goal is to classify which digit is present in an image.
